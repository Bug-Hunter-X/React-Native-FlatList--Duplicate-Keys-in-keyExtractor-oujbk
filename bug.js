In React Native, when working with FlatList and using the `keyExtractor` prop, an error might occur if the key you provide is not unique for each item.  This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as items not rendering correctly, or incorrect updates when data changes.

For instance:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' }, { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' }, { id: 1, name: 'Item 3' } ]}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```

In this example, the `id` property is not unique, causing the `keyExtractor` to fail.  This will lead to `Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop`.
